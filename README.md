Final Project Description

	When I was brainstorming ideas for a final project, I wanted to create something that would provide value to people stuck in the   homes all over the world but still want to experience the fun of trying a new cocktail! The way this program is structured is simple, users   are asked to select their base-alcohol preference (i.e. “Vodka”) and from there the program instructs them how to make a random cocktail   using that base. For example, if you select “Tequila”, you may learn how to make a Tequila Sunrise, or the world-famous Paloma! I think   now more than ever, we need to get out of our routines and try new things! Since many people cooped up at home are still drinking alcohol,   I think it is a great idea to encourage people to add new varieties to their standard cocktail choices!
